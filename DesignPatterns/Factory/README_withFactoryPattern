
Your employer was  using Oracle database now, however, 
now, they now want to use Cassandra 

You only need to change one place
DBInfo.java 

change the statement with DBInfo.java
 public static String DBName = "Oracle";
 
 to 

 public static String DBName = "Cassandra";
 
 and you are done! 
 
 In summary, 
 The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, 
 we need to return one of the sub-class. 
 This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class 
 from the client program to the factory class.
