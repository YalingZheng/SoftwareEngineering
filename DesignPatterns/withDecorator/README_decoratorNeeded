Now, let's take a look at the decoration portion. So far, all is good, and we can draw Circle and Rectangle. 
But, we would like to have some additional functionalities for the Shape,
like Fill-Color, Line-Color,  Line-Thinkness, Line-Style, and so on.

First, we will create an abstract wrapper (decorator) class that implements the Shape. 
I will use theShapeDecorator for this example.
