
Your employer was  using Oracle database now, however, 
now, they now want to use Cassandra 

So all places you have the statements like 

DB curdatabase = new Oracle();
DB curdatabase = new           Oracle();

or 

Oracle curdatabase = new Oracle(); 
Oracle curdatabase = new    Oracle(); 

needs to be changed to 

DB curdatabase = new Cassandra();
or
Cassandra curdatabase = new Cassandra();
